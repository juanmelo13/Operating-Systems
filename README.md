# Operating-Systems
Repo for my projects for the Operating Systems Class. In this class we explored the multiple tasks that the operating system has to acomplish,
and some of the tools it uses in order to provide the user experience that we know.

Projects included:
  * Process Fork -- 2/1/2021
  * Memsim -- 3/2/2021
